Analyzing Swiggy: Bangalore Delivery Outlet Data

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing data from Swiggy, a prominent online food ordering and delivery platform, specifically focusing on delivery outlets in Bangalore. The aim is to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the dataset and conduct data mining to uncover valuable insights and meaningful relationships between different attributes. This analysis falls under the domain of Business Intelligence within the food industry and is classified as an advanced-level project.

Technologies Used

ETL Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Database Management: SQL
Business Intelligence Tools: Tableau/Power BI
Other Libraries: Scikit-learn for machine learning models
Problem Statement
The online food ordering market encompasses various segments, including foods prepared by restaurants, independent individuals, and groceries ordered online for pickup or delivery. This project aims to analyze the delivery outlet data from Swiggy to derive key metrics and factors, and demonstrate meaningful relationships between attributes through thorough data mining.

Objectives

Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) on the Swiggy dataset.
Conduct data mining to discover key metrics and factors.
Identify and demonstrate meaningful relationships between attributes.
Visualize findings using appropriate BI tools and visualization libraries.
Provide actionable insights based on the analysis.

Key Metrics and Factors to Explore

Order Volume: Number of orders per outlet, per day, per cuisine, etc.
Delivery Time: Average delivery time, time variance, peak hours, etc.
Customer Ratings: Average ratings, distribution of ratings, factors influencing ratings.
Revenue: Revenue per outlet, per cuisine, etc.
Popular Cuisines: Most ordered cuisines, seasonal variations.
Geographical Analysis: Delivery hotspots, areas with high demand.

ETL Process
Extract: Load the dataset from a CSV file or database.

Transform:

Data cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
Data integration: Combine data from multiple sources if applicable.
Data transformation: Normalize data, create new derived columns.
Load: Store the cleaned and transformed data into a database or a data warehouse for analysis.

Data Mining and Analysis
